Gunshot Detection using matlab tool and correlation techniques  - a "Shotspotter" inspired project

This was a collaborative projects that I did with my peers. The code analysis sound data in in gunshot_array and categorises whether the clip was of gunshot or not.
Moreover the code also tracks the postion from where the shot might have take from.
